# Biobank-scale genetic characterization of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias across diverse populations
## Summary
This is the online repository for the original article titled "Biobank-scale genetic characterization of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias across diverse populations." This study aims to conduct genetic characterization of key genes associated with dementia across different ancestry populations using the largest biobank-scale datasets, including AllofUs, UK Biobank, ADSP, AMP-DLB, and Genomics England.
