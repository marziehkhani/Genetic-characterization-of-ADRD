# Biobank-scale genetic characterization of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias across diverse populations
## Summary
This is the online repository for the original article titled "Biobank-scale genetic characterization of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias across diverse populations." This study aims to conduct genetic characterization of key genes associated with dementia across different ancestry populations using the largest biobank-scale datasets, including AllofUs, UK Biobank, ADSP, AMP-DLB, and Genomics England.
### Data Statement 
* The All of Us genomic data are available under restricted access for human subject data. Access can be obtained by following the instructions under the All of Us workbench
* Primary data from the 100KGP, which are held in a secure Research Environment, are available to registered users. Please see https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-gecip/for-gecip-members/data-and-data-access for further information

  # Repository Orientation
